1. Headcount by Department & Gender
   
Chart Type: Clustered Bar Chart
- Total Employees: 152
- HR: 10 (6 Female, 4 Male)
- Engineering: 50 (40 Male, 10 Female)
- Sales: 30 (12 Female, 18 Male)
- Operations: 40 (25 Male, 15 Female)

Interpretation: The organization is male-dominated in Engineering and Operations. Diversity efforts could focus on hiring more women in technical roles.

2. Monthly Turnover Rate
   
Chart Type: Line Chart
- Peak Turnover in June (12 exits)
- Average Monthly Turnover: 4.7%

Interpretation: Mid-year spikes in attrition may indicate seasonal dissatisfaction or contract endings. Recommend exit interviews and engagement initiatives in Q2.

3. Average Tenure
   
Chart Type: KPI Card
- Average Employee Tenure: 3.2 years

Interpretation: This is within a healthy range. However, investigate if high-performing employees are leaving earlier than expected.

4. Time to Hire
   
Chart Type: Bar or KPI
- Average Time to Hire: 27 days

Interpretation: This is close to the global benchmark (~30 days). However, if Engineering roles take >40 days, optimize sourcing strategies for niche talent.

5. Offer Acceptance Rate
   
Chart Type: Gauge
- Offers Made: 40
- Offers Accepted: 34
- Acceptance Rate: 85%

Interpretation: A good sign that your employer brand and offer packages are attractive. Review reasons for declined offers to hit 90%+.

6. Performance Rating Distribution
   
Chart Type: Pie or Bar Chart
- Exceeds Expectations: 20%
- Meets Expectations: 65%
- Below Expectations: 15%

Interpretation: Most employees are performing as expected, but 15% underperformance requires follow-up coaching or PIPs.

7. Training Completion Rate
   
Chart Type: Bar Chart
- Compliance Training: 98%
- Leadership Training: 70%

Interpretation: While mandatory training has high uptake, leadership development needs stronger participation or better scheduling.

8. eNPS (Employee Net Promoter Score)
   
Chart Type: KPI or Bar
- Promoters: 50%
- Passives: 30%
- Detractors: 20%
- eNPS Score: +30

Interpretation: A solid employee sentiment score. Focus group follow-up may improve the score and deepen loyalty.

9. Revenue per Employee
    
Chart Type: KPI
- Total Revenue: $4,000,000
- Employees: 152
- Revenue per Employee: $26,316

Interpretation: Benchmark this with industry standards to assess productivity. If revenue rises faster than headcount, that’s a good sign.

10. Internal Mobility Rate
    
Chart Type: Column Chart
- Internal Moves: 12 in the last 12 months
- Internal Mobility Rate: 7.8%

Interpretation: Indicates moderate career development. Track mobility by gender and department to identify gaps in promotion equity.
